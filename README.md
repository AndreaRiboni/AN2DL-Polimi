## Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning
### Homework 1: Image classification
Plant species classification
- Convolutional Neural Network from scratch
- Ensemble of 
  - Transfer Learning with Xception
  - Transfer Learning with EfficientNet

### Homework 2: Time series classification
After experimenting with purely-convolutional networks, LSTMs, GRUs, BiLSTMs and Transformers, the best model was obtained with a hybrid of pure-LSTM and pure-convolutional
